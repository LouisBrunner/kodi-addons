# LouisBrunner's Kodi Addons

In this repository you can find my Kodi Addons:

 * [DROPOUT](https://dropout.tv): Watch Dropout.tv shows

## Installation

Add `https://louisbrunner.github.io/kodi-addons/` in Kodi's **File manager** then install `repo.zip` through **Addons > Install from zip file**. You will then get access to all the addons.

## Issues:

 * Search doesn't automatically search (some kind of race condition?)
